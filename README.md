# The Shop App
Here is an example shop application that I built, following a lesson-plan from Academind, to learn the basics of the React Native Framework.

# Libraries Used
- Redux / React-Redux
- Redux Thunk
- React Navigation
- Moment
- Validate.js

# Technologies Used
- Git / GitHub (Version Control)
- Google Firebase: This acted as a pseudo-backend for the application, storing product and order information, as well as hold User Authentication for this application.
- REST APIs: Google Consumed the Google Firebase REST APIs to GET, PUT and POST data to the "backend servers"
